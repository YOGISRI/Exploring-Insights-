# Exploring Insights
**Project Name**: Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik

The main theme of the analysis is to improve services to enhance customer satisfaction and maintain an eco-friendly environment for both business professionals and customers. The downloaded data contains passenger details, flight status, and pilot details. Based on the provided data, we can create visualizations and dashboards by following the steps outlined below.

In this project, data is collected from a database and loaded into Qlik Cloud Analytics. The data is pre-processed, which involves cleaning (removing hyphens and whitespace) and adding some fields. This pre-processed data is then used to create visualizations and dashboards. These dashboards and visualizations are pictorial representations of the data, enabling us to present our analysis in a more efficient manner. For dashboard creation, we use the Analyze sheet, where we can view fields and charts. Additionally, we are facilitated by the Insight Advisor to ask questions. After creating dashboards, take snapshots of each visualization to aid in storytelling. Then, work on story narration, which resembles a PowerPoint presentation.
